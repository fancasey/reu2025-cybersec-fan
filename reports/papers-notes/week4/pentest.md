## Overview
Penetration testing is when companies hire "ethical hackers" to try and find vulnerabilities in their system. Hackers may or may not have a formal education. It is often better to hire hackers who are not aware of the system being tested, as they might see blind spots the developers don't. 

## Types of pen tests
- Open-box
- Closed-box
- Covert
    - "double blind" kind of testing where IT/security officials don't know the attack is happening
- External
    - attacking from the "outside" (could be literally)
- Internal
    - From within the company network

## Stages
- Reconnaissance
    - gathering info/data to plan attack
- Attack
    - eg brute-force attack, SQL injection, social engineering techniques, physical devices
- Coverup
    - steps to avoid detection
