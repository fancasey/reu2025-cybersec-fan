# Tutorials and Demos
Code I copied from tutorials (from Vlad & AutoGen website/docs) to help myself get familiar with the program.

## What is Autogen?
Autogen is a framework that allows you to easily create agents, as well as multi-agent teams. There is support for most/all of the popular LLM APIs; the LLM functions as the agent's "brain". It has good support for tools, as well as rich documentation on how to use it as well as various design patterns. There are many ways to get tools (create your own function, get one from MCP, https, etc), and tools are used by the agents to perform actions based on their thoughts (from the LLM).
