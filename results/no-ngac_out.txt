Proposal: NSF Small; funding: $10000, proposal: we test LLMs for automated proposal workflows and will use formal methods and math theory of sets and relations. 
                 We will use animals(Dogs) to evaluate the results. 
                 Project id: 12345.
---------- ThoughtEvent (pi_agent) ----------
Thank you for providing the proposal details. Everything seems in order for the initial review. I will proceed to submit the proposal and transfer it to the current approval entity for further approval.

Since this proposal involves elements related to both computer science and mathematics, I will transfer it to both the CS Chair and Math Chair for approval.

Let's proceed.
