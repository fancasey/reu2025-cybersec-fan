Proposal: NSF Small; funding: $10000, proposal: we test LLMs for automated proposal workflows and will use formal methods and math theory of sets and relations. 
                 We will use animals(Dogs) to evaluate the results. 
                 Project id: 12345.

It appears that the proposal datasheet is complete with project id, funding information, and project description.

Now, I will submit the proposal and transfer it to both the CS Chair and Math Chair for approval, as the proposal involves elements related to computing and mathematical theory. Let's proceed.
