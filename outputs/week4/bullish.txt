| Warren Buffett | NEUTRAL  |        60.0% | First, let me say that Apple isn't just a company, it's      |
|                |          |              | almost a consumer phenomenon. Now, does this fall within my  |
|                |          |              | circle of competence? Absolutely. I've always treated Apple  |
|                |          |              | as a consumer products company with a sticky ecosystem, much |
|                |          |              | like Coca-Cola, which nicely anchors it in my understanding. |
|                |          |              | Using and experiencing their products can be likened to      |
|                |          |              | enjoying a refreshing Coke—both create a sense of loyalty    |
|                |          |              | and repeat business. Looking at Apple's competitive moat,    |
|                |          |              | it's truly exceptional. The consistent return on equity over |
|                |          |              | ten periods, averaging 154.1%, is testament to its robust    |
|                |          |              | brand and operational efficiencies—like a well-polished      |
|                |          |              | See's Candies that just keeps delivering quality. The        |
|                |          |              | company clearly has great pricing power and durable          |
|                |          |              | competitive advantages. Management appears to be on solid    |
|                |          |              | ground. They are acting in the shareholders' interests,      |
|                |          |              | repurchasing shares, and maintaining dividends, akin to how  |
|                |          |              | GEICO steadily grows value for its policyholders. Smart      |
|                |          |              | capital allocation is a hallmark here, and that's a tick in  |
|                |          |              | the box. Financially speaking, Apple shows strengths and     |
|                |          |              | weaknesses. While they achieve operating margins with an     |
|                |          |              | average stability of 30.4%, the high debt to equity ratio of |
|                |          |              | 4.0 and weak liquidity with a current ratio of 0.8 raise     |
|                |          |              | eyebrows. Strong margins are good, but I like my fortress    |
|                |          |              | investments to be less leveraged. When it comes to           |
|                |          |              | valuation, Apple's market cap far exceeds its intrinsic      |
|                |          |              | value by my calculations, with a negative margin of safety   |
|                |          |              | of 68.6%. That’s like buying a superb piano at an excessive  |
|                |          |              | premium—it might play beautifully, but you should wait for   |
|                |          |              | the right price. In terms of long-term prospects, there’s    |
|                |          |              | much going for Apple. It's built to last with its ecosystem. |
|                |          |              | But, we should consider the rapid pace of technology as a    |
|                |          |              | headwind—albeit a minor one due to Apple's brand strength.   |
|                |          |              | So, how does this compare to other opportunities? In my      |
|                |          |              | portfolio, I favor safety and margins of safety more than    |
|                |          |              | anything. I own Apple for its exceptional business           |
|                |          |              | responsiveness and customer loyalty, similar to why I invest |
|                |          |              | in Coca-Cola. But as it stands, the company is trading much  |
|                |          |              | above what I deem an intrinsic price. Overall, I’d say it's  |
|                |          |              | a neutral opportunity with the current valuation—not quite   |
|                |          |              | the wonderful business at a fair price I would prefer, but   |
|                |          |              | certainly one to watch closely.                              |

| Warren Buffett | NEUTRAL  |        75.0% | Let's start by confirming the most critical factor - circle  |
|                |          |              | of competence: Apple is indeed within my circle due to its   |
|                |          |              | position not just as a tech company, but as a consumer       |
|                |          |              | products powerhouse with a formidable ecosystem, akin to     |
|                |          |              | See's Candies in its brand loyalty and customer retention.   |
|                |          |              | Apple's competitive moat is reflected in its impressive ROE  |
|                |          |              | and operational margins, showcasing strong pricing power and |
|                |          |              | efficient asset utilization. They've maintained a stable     |
|                |          |              | operating margin average of over 30%, which points to a      |
|                |          |              | durable advantage. Management deserves a nod as well for     |
|                |          |              | being shareholder-friendly, repurchasing shares and issuing  |
|                |          |              | dividends. However, when we assess the numbers, a high       |
|                |          |              | debt-to-equity ratio and low liquidity (current ratio under  |
|                |          |              | 1) raise eyebrows on their financial health. Despite Apple's |
|                |          |              | historical strength, valuations are not attractive at this   |
|                |          |              | time. The company's market cap far exceeds its calculated    |
|                |          |              | intrinsic value, lacking a margin of safety—a cornerstone of |
|                |          |              | my investment philosophy. When considering its long-term     |
|                |          |              | prospects, Apple still appears poised to maintain growth     |
|                |          |              | with its robust ecosystem, but current growth rates have     |
|                |          |              | slowed significantly. Additionally, the current valuation    |
|                |          |              | provides limited room for upside. Unlike Coca-Cola or GEICO, |
|                |          |              | which offered significant intrinsic value above market price |
|                |          |              | at the time of investment, Apple's premium pricing now       |
|                |          |              | weighs against it. This evaluation leaves the investment in  |
|                |          |              | a 'neutral' position for me. Until Apple's market cap aligns |
|                |          |              | closer with its intrinsic value, it's wiser to hold rather   |
|                |          |              | than increase positions.                                     |
