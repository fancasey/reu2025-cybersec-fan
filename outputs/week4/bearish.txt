| Warren Buffett | NEUTRAL  |        75.0% | Well, folks, when it comes to investing, Apple's one of      |
|                |          |              | those companies I can speak about with a fair bit of         |
|                |          |              | confidence, given its role as a consumer products company    |
|                |          |              | rather than a tech company. It fits snugly within my circle  |
|                |          |              | of competence due to its exceptional ecosystem and brand     |
|                |          |              | power, much like our investment in Coca-Cola. Apple's got a  |
|                |          |              | strong moat, evidenced by its consistently high return on    |
|                |          |              | equity of about 151.3%, which tells me it's got a durable    |
|                |          |              | competitive advantage and enjoys significant pricing power   |
|                |          |              | due to its brand loyalty and large ecosystem. Management     |
|                |          |              | appears to be doing a commendable job, focusing on           |
|                |          |              | shareholder returns via share repurchases and a history of   |
|                |          |              | dividend payments, which indicates smart capital allocation. |
|                |          |              | However, when we look a bit closer at the financials, things |
|                |          |              | aren't entirely rosy. High debt levels with a debt to equity |
|                |          |              | ratio of 4.0 and a current ratio under 1 mean liquidity is   |
|                |          |              | weak, which is something we need to keep an eye on. Also,    |
|                |          |              | Apple's trading at a hefty valuation with a                  |
|                |          |              | price-to-earnings ratio north of 33 and a significant margin |
|                |          |              | of safety deficit when stacking up against its intrinsic     |
|                |          |              | value, which we estimate quite below its current market cap. |
|                |          |              | While Apple's got solid long-term prospects given its brand  |
|                |          |              | and ecosystem, I can't overlook the valuation concern,       |
|                |          |              | especially with modest growth rates and cautious intrinsic   |
|                |          |              | value projections. Compared to other opportunities, like     |
|                |          |              | Coca-Cola or GEICO, where the margin of safety and financial |
|                |          |              | health were clearer, Apple's not quite as compelling at      |
|                |          |              | present prices. As always, I'd rather own a wonderful        |
|                |          |              | business at a fair price, which makes me cautious here.      |
|                |          |              | Thus, my advice would be to wait for a better entry point.   |

| Warren Buffett | NEUTRAL  |        75.0% | Now, looking at Apple, we have a classic case of a company   |
|                |          |              | that I've come to understand not just as a tech stock, but   |
|                |          |              | as a formidable consumer products company with a deep moat   |
|                |          |              | in its ecosystem. This sits comfortably within my circle of  |
|                |          |              | competence, much like our long-standing investments in       |
|                |          |              | Coca-Cola or See's Candies, which benefit from brand         |
|                |          |              | strength and customer loyalty. As for the competitive moat,  |
|                |          |              | Apple showcases one of the strongest I've seen, akin to the  |
|                |          |              | defensive walls around a medieval castle. Their ecosystem    |
|                |          |              | creates significant switching costs, providing a durable     |
|                |          |              | competitive advantage as evidenced by their ROE consistency  |
|                |          |              | of 154.1% on average over 10 periods. This is remarkably     |
|                |          |              | high, suggesting they possess strong pricing power and       |
|                |          |              | operational efficiency, contributing to their moat.          |
|                |          |              | Management appears committed to acting in shareholders'      |
|                |          |              | interests, with ongoing share repurchases and a steady       |
|                |          |              | dividend policy, reminiscent of GEICO's prudent capital      |
|                |          |              | allocation strategies. However, high debt to equity ratio of |
|                |          |              | 4.0 is a bit concerning, indicating greater financial        |
|                |          |              | leverage than I'd typically entertain. On financial health,  |
|                |          |              | while the operating margins and ROE impress, liquidity is    |
|                |          |              | less robust than I'd prefer, with a current ratio of 0.8.    |
|                |          |              | Such a figure, if not improved, could hint at vulnerability  |
|                |          |              | in tougher times. Apple’s earnings growth does seem to have  |
|                |          |              | hit a bit of a plateau, which needs some careful watching.   |
|                |          |              | Valuation is where things get tricky. With an intrinsic      |
|                |          |              | value significantly below the current market cap, reflected  |
|                |          |              | by a negative margin of safety, it seems we're paying quite  |
|                |          |              | a premium. It's like paying a hefty sum for a prime piece of |
|                |          |              | real estate during a seller’s market. I prefer a fair price  |
|                |          |              | for a wonderful business, and this seems somewhat skewed.    |
|                |          |              | Long-term, Apple's integration into consumer lifestyles and  |
|                |          |              | its innovation track record bode well, but those top-line    |
|                |          |              | growth rates raise an eyebrow. Compared to other             |
|                |          |              | opportunities like railways and utilities, where I have a    |
|                |          |              | clear, steady cash flow visibility, Apple currently presents |
|                |          |              | more uncertainty. In conclusion, while Apple remains a       |
|                |          |              | quality business within my circle of competence and          |
|                |          |              | completes the criteria for a moat and management, its        |
|                |          |              | current valuation and financial ratios warrant a more        |
|                |          |              | cautious stance. In investing, as in bridge, sometimes you   |
|                |          |              | must pass even when the hand looks moderately good.          |
