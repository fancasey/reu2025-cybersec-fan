| Warren Buffett | BEARISH  |        70.0% | First, let's talk about the circle of competence. Now, while |
|                |          |              | Apple is often categorized as a tech company, I consider it  |
|                |          |              | more of a consumer products company due to its strong        |
|                |          |              | ecosystem that creates switching costs for customers, much   |
|                |          |              | like Coca-Cola’s brand loyalty. So yes, it's within my       |
|                |          |              | circle of competence, and that’s a critical first step.      |
|                |          |              | Next, looking at Apple's moat, the company boasts an         |
|                |          |              | excellent return on equity, averaging 154.1% over 10         |
|                |          |              | periods, which speaks to its durable competitive advantage.  |
|                |          |              | The strong and stable operating margins also indicate        |
|                |          |              | significant pricing power, though it's worth mentioning that |
|                |          |              | the analysis dataset noted limited information on pricing    |
|                |          |              | power, which could raise eyebrows. When it comes to          |
|                |          |              | management, Apple has consistently repurchased shares,       |
|                |          |              | showing shareholder-friendly practices. Their good cash flow |
|                |          |              | coupled with a history of dividend payments reflects         |
|                |          |              | competent capital allocation, akin to how GEICO has been a   |
|                |          |              | reliable performer in our insurance segment. Financially,    |
|                |          |              | Apple displays a strong balance sheet but with some caveats. |
|                |          |              | The high debt-to-equity ratio of 4.0 is notable. While the   |
|                |          |              | liquidity metrics like a current ratio of 0.8 signal some    |
|                |          |              | strain, Apple's massive market cap supports resilience, much |
|                |          |              | like BNSF's robust network underpinning its operations. On   |
|                |          |              | valuation, Apple’s intrinsic value is estimated at around    |
|                |          |              | $930 billion when being conservative, whereas the market cap |
|                |          |              | is significantly higher at $2.96 trillion. This suggests the |
|                |          |              | stock is priced above its intrinsic value, leaving little to |
|                |          |              | no margin of safety currently—something as important as      |
|                |          |              | paying a reasonable price for a wonderful business.          |
|                |          |              | Prospect-wise, Apple faces minimal earnings and revenue      |
|                |          |              | growth based on recent figures, signaling potential          |
|                |          |              | headwinds or market saturation challenges. For the long      |
|                |          |              | haul, while the brand is undoubtedly stalwart, such growth   |
|                |          |              | rates—just around 1% to 2%—are something to watch closely.   |
|                |          |              | In comparison to other opportunities in the portfolio like   |
|                |          |              | Coca-Cola or Bank of America, where the economic moats are   |
|                |          |              | strongly backed by favorable pricing and valuation, Apple    |
|                |          |              | seems a bit stretched on pricing at the current levels.      |
|                |          |              | Remember, I'd rather own a wonderful business at a fair      |
|                |          |              | price than get caught paying too high for even a great       |
|                |          |              | company. Drawing on my experience, when the margin of safety |
|                |          |              | isn't present, patience often serves better than haste.      |

| Warren Buffett | NEUTRAL  |        65.0% | Alright, folks, let's talk about Apple, a company I'm quite  |
|                |          |              | familiar with and have a significant investment in. Now, the |
|                |          |              | first thing we do around here is determine if it falls       |
|                |          |              | within my circle of competence. Well, Apple certainly does.  |
|                |          |              | Despite being a tech company, it operates in the realm of    |
|                |          |              | consumer products with a strong ecosystem that fosters       |
|                |          |              | switching costs and customer loyalty, much like Coca-Cola or |
|                |          |              | See's Candies do with their respective customer bases. Now,  |
|                |          |              | let's look at the business's competitive moat. Apple's       |
|                |          |              | ecosystem is a fortress—it's got pricing power and brand     |
|                |          |              | strength, akin to our favorite consumer brands. High         |
|                |          |              | consistency in ROE over the past ten periods reflects that   |
|                |          |              | competitive advantage. Management quality and capital        |
|                |          |              | allocation are areas where Apple shines. They're             |
|                |          |              | shareholder-friendly, regularly repurchasing shares, and pay |
|                |          |              | dividends, very much like the way we run things at           |
|                |          |              | Berkshire. Financial health, however, presents a mixed bag.  |
|                |          |              | Apple's strong margins and high ROE are impressive, but the  |
|                |          |              | high debt to equity ratio of 4.0 and low current ratio of    |
|                |          |              | 0.8 do raise some eyebrows, indicating potential liquidity   |
|                |          |              | concerns. As for valuation, every savvy investor knows that  |
|                |          |              | 'price is what you pay, value is what you get.' With a       |
|                |          |              | market cap of $3.27 trillion but an intrinsic value assessed |
|                |          |              | at around $931 billion, it appears the stock is trading at a |
|                |          |              | premium, resulting in a negative margin of safety. A red     |
|                |          |              | flag, if you will. Considering Apple's long-term prospects,  |
|                |          |              | they remain robust, given its strong brand and innovation    |
|                |          |              | track record. Nevertheless, slow earnings growth and revenue |
|                |          |              | growth hint at challenges. Compared to other holdings in my  |
|                |          |              | portfolio like Coca-Cola or BNSF, where I see greater value  |
|                |          |              | relative to their intrinsic value, Apple's current price     |
|                |          |              | seems less justifiable. In balancing all these factors, I'm  |
|                |          |              | signaling 'neutral' on Apple at this time with a 65%         |
|                |          |              | confidence level. It's a great company, but I'd like to see  |
|                |          |              | a more compelling alignment of value and price before        |
|                |          |              | feeling more bullish.                                        |

| Warren Buffett | NEUTRAL  |        65.0% | First and foremost, Apple falls squarely within my circle of |
|                |          |              | competence. Although it's a tech company, I see it more as a |
|                |          |              | consumer products company with a strong brand and an         |
|                |          |              | ecosystem that creates real switching costs, much like my    |
|                |          |              | interest in Coca-Cola and its brand strength. Apple's        |
|                |          |              | excellent return on equity over the years indicates a        |
|                |          |              | durable competitive advantage—a real economic moat. However, |
|                |          |              | the high debt-to-equity ratio is a concern, reflecting       |
|                |          |              | increased leverage that could impact financial stability.    |
|                |          |              | Despite this, Apple has shown strong operating margins, a    |
|                |          |              | testament to its pricing power, much like See's Candies.     |
|                |          |              | Management seems to be aligned with shareholders' interests, |
|                |          |              | as they've been repurchasing shares, much like we do at      |
|                |          |              | Berkshire when the value is there, and paying dividends      |
|                |          |              | consistently. Yet, I would have liked to see better          |
|                |          |              | liquidity ratios for more financial flexibility. When it     |
|                |          |              | comes to valuation, the intrinsic value analysis indicates a |
|                |          |              | significant overvaluation compared to the current market     |
|                |          |              | cap. This margin of safety is negative, which always makes   |
|                |          |              | me cautious—price is what you pay, value is what you get.    |
|                |          |              | Apple's inconsistent earnings growth in recent years is also |
|                |          |              | a red flag. Looking towards the long term, Apple has a       |
|                |          |              | stable place in the consumer ecosystem, akin to how trains   |
|                |          |              | like BNSF serve as the backbone of US transportation. But    |
|                |          |              | its prospects are clouded by high relative valuation. Given  |
|                |          |              | the myriad opportunities, I have in staple industries with   |
|                |          |              | better valuations and financial metrics, this isn't a        |
|                |          |              | screaming buy at the current price. Like I always say, 'I'd  |
|                |          |              | rather own a wonderful business at a fair price than a fair  |
|                |          |              | business at a wonderful price.' Right now, with Apple, we    |
|                |          |              | have a wonderful business at an unjustifiable price.         |

| Reasoning  | Given the neutral signal with moderate confidence of 65.0%   |
|            | and the team's strategy aimed towards shorting, the decision |
|            | is to short the maximum allowed quantity of 99 shares. Since |

|            | positions in AAPL, this allows us to potentially capitalize  |
|            | on any downside movement without exceeding any portfolio     |
|            | constraints.                                                 |
