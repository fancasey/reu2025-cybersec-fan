| Warren Buffett | NEUTRAL  |        70.0% | Now, as we take a stroll down this investment path for       |
|                |          |              | Apple, let's remember that this is a company that, despite   |
|                |          |              | being in technology, operates like a consumer products       |
|                |          |              | company with an ecosystem that creates significant switching |
|                |          |              | costs—a unique exception within my circle of competence.     |
|                |          |              | It's like Coca-Cola in the tech arena, with its strong brand |
|                |          |              | and customer loyalty. Looking at the competitive moat,       |
|                |          |              | Apple's robust return on equity (ROE) and strong operating   |
|                |          |              | margins are clear indicators of a durable competitive        |
|                |          |              | advantage. It has an impressive record of consistent ROEs    |
|                |          |              | above 15%, which is the hallmark of a company with a strong  |
|                |          |              | economic moat, much like See's Candies' pricing power. As    |
|                |          |              | for management, they're savvy capital allocators,            |
|                |          |              | repurchasing shares and maintaining a dividend, which speaks |
|                |          |              | to their shareholder-friendly approach. This echoes what     |
|                |          |              | we've seen with other well-managed companies in our          |
|                |          |              | portfolio, like GEICO, where there is an alignment with      |
|                |          |              | shareholder interests. Now, turning our attention to the     |
|                |          |              | financials, Apple's high debt-to-equity ratio is a bit       |
|                |          |              | concerning at 4.0, which doesn't fit as smoothly into my     |
|                |          |              | financial fortress preference. The liquidity, with a current |
|                |          |              | ratio of 0.8, is also on the weaker side, raising a red      |
|                |          |              | flag. However, the solid earnings and margins provide some   |
|                |          |              | assurance. A company like Apple, with its stable operating   |
|                |          |              | margins, often can withstand such debt due to its pricing    |
|                |          |              | power and brand strength. Intrinsic value showcases a        |
|                |          |              | significant mismatch, with the present market capitalization |
|                |          |              | far exceeding our conservatively estimated intrinsic value,  |
|                |          |              | leading to a negative margin of safety. This calls for a     |
|                |          |              | certain degree of patience, as I prefer buying great         |
|                |          |              | companies like Apple only when they're reasonably priced.    |
|                |          |              | Looking to the future, Apple has a strong ecosystem and      |
|                |          |              | loyal customer base, akin to the 'forever' companies I       |
|                |          |              | prefer. But with modest revenue and earnings growth, it      |
|                |          |              | doesn't provide the type of growth prospects that other      |
|                |          |              | investments currently might offer. Compared to other         |
|                |          |              | opportunities in our portfolio, the intrinsic value          |
|                |          |              | discrepancy and high valuations make this a less compelling  |
|                |          |              | buy at the moment. It's like a fine candy that's priced a    |
|                |          |              | bit too high; not a bad choice, but perhaps not the sweetest |
|                |          |              | deal on the shelf right now. So, while Apple remains a       |
|                |          |              | wonderful company, its current valuation makes it a prudent  |
|                |          |              | moment to wait for a better price before biting further into |
|                |          |              | this apple.                                                  |

| Warren Buffett | NEUTRAL  |        65.0% | Let's dive into this opportunity with Apple. First and       |
|                |          |              | foremost, it's squarely within my circle of competence.      |
|                |          |              | While it's a tech company, I focus on Apple as a consumer    |
|                |          |              | products business with a robust ecosystem that creates       |
|                |          |              | significant switching costs for its users. This is much like |
|                |          |              | our experience with Coca-Cola or See's Candies, where brand  |
|                |          |              | strength and consumer loyalty are paramount. Apple's         |
|                |          |              | competitive moat is strong as shown by its exceptional ROE   |
|                |          |              | consistency and durable operating margins, indicating        |
|                |          |              | excellent pricing power and operational efficiency. The      |
|                |          |              | company has ensured it isn't just riding a trend but has     |
|                |          |              | built a fortress of competitive advantages, much like when   |
|                |          |              | we first saw the scalable moat of GEICO in the insurance     |
|                |          |              | industry. Management appears to be shareholder-friendly,     |
|                |          |              | demonstrated by their share repurchases and consistent       |
|                |          |              | dividends—actions that show they think like owners, which is |
|                |          |              | a fundamental quality we value highly. However, financially, |
|                |          |              | there are some concerns to be aware of. The high debt to     |
|                |          |              | equity ratio is a little like finding too much sugar in my   |
|                |          |              | favorite Coke – it's not ideal, but manageable if watched    |
|                |          |              | closely. The current ratio is below 1, indicating potential  |
|                |          |              | liquidity concerns if not managed prudently. Their earnings  |
|                |          |              | growth has been inconsistent, which raises a bit of caution  |
|                |          |              | as consistency in earnings is the bedrock of our             |
|                |          |              | investments. Valuation-wise, the intrinsic value analysis    |
|                |          |              | suggests the stock is significantly overvalued with a margin |
|                |          |              | of safety of -68.6%, which is akin to galloping far ahead of |
|                |          |              | the intrinsic horse. I'd say the current valuation presents  |
|                |          |              | a classic case of a great business at a not-so-great         |
|                |          |              | price—overvalued with little room for error. Considering     |
|                |          |              | long-term prospects, Apple continues to innovate and         |
|                |          |              | maintain its user ecosystem, but I do not see the same       |
|                |          |              | apparent growth trajectory or clear bargain pricing as when  |
|                |          |              | we initially invested in it. Comparatively, when I look at   |
|                |          |              | other portfolio staples like Coca-Cola or our strong rails,  |
|                |          |              | the valuation is more aligned with our margin of safety      |
|                |          |              | expectations. I'm inclined to keep Apple on our watchlist    |
|                |          |              | but not actively add more at this price point. In essence,   |
|                |          |              | it's a wonderful business that today comes with a premium    |
|                |          |              | ticket, thus, a bit of patience is warranted.                |

|                |          |              | competence. I've invested significantly in Apple, not as a   |
|                |          |              | tech company, but as a consumer products powerhouse with a   |
|                |          |              | sticky ecosystem that creates substantial switching costs.   |
|                |          |              | Apple's moat is undoubtedly impressive, with consistently    |

|                |          |              | managed. Management, on the other hand, seems to be making   |
|                |          |              | shareholder-friendly decisions by repurchasing shares and    |
|                |          |              | maintaining a history of dividend payments, which is always  |
|                |          |              | a good sign. When it comes to valuation, Apple appears to be |
|                |          |              | trading at a premium relative to its intrinsic value, with   |
|                |          |              | the margin of safety indicating the market price             |
|                |          |              | significantly exceeds our conservative estimate of intrinsic |
|                |          |              | value by about 68.5%. Pricing power analysis is limited, but |
|                |          |              | the company's brand and loyal customer base should allow for |
|                |          |              | some level of price increases without losing customers. The  |
|                |          |              | long-term prospects are generally strong, but the modest     |
|                |          |              | growth rates in revenue and earnings signal a plateau that   |
|                |          |              | needs addressing. Compared to other opportunities in my      |
|                |          |              | portfolio, such as Coca-Cola or See's Candies, which offer   |
|                |          |              | more predictable cash flows and simpler business models,     |
|                |          |              | Apple carries a bit more complexity and financial leverage.  |
|                |          |              | In summary, while I remain a shareholder, I believe the      |
|                |          |              | current market price doesn't provide an adequate margin of   |
|                |          |              | safety to warrant additional investment at this time.        |
