| Warren Buffett | NEUTRAL  |        70.0% | Apple is one of those rare exceptions that straddle both     |
|                |          |              | tech and consumer products, placing it squarely within my    |
|                |          |              | circle of competence due to its robust ecosystem. This       |
|                |          |              | ecosystem creates significant switching costs, giving the    |
|                |          |              | company a durable competitive moat. The operating margins    |
|                |          |              | and ROE are strong, showcasing excellent pricing power, and  |
|                |          |              | management has demonstrated shareholder-friendly practices   |
|                |          |              | through buybacks and dividends. However, the high            |
|                |          |              | debt-to-equity ratio is a bit concerning, indicating a       |
|                |          |              | reliance on debt that should be monitored despite their      |
|                |          |              | ability to generate cash. Their current ratio suggests       |
|                |          |              | potential liquidity challenges, but their cash generation    |
|                |          |              | capacity somewhat mitigates this. The intrinsic value        |
|                |          |              | calculation shows that the market is currently valuing Apple |
|                |          |              | significantly higher than the conservative intrinsic value   |
|                |          |              | estimate, meaning there's a negative margin of safety—a      |
|                |          |              | critical factor in my decision-making. While Apple remains a |
|                |          |              | quality business and an integral player in the Berkshire     |
|                |          |              | Hathaway portfolio, the current valuation does not provide   |
|                |          |              | the margin of safety I typically require. In comparison to   |
|                |          |              | other opportunities available, there's a need for patience   |
|                |          |              | here. If the price adjusts to offer a margin of safety, it   |
|                |          |              | would become more attractive. For now, while bullish on      |
|                |          |              | Apple's long-term prospects, I'm cautious about adding more  |
|                |          |              | at present valuations.                                       |

| Warren Buffett | NEUTRAL  |        75.0% | Let's dive into Apple, a company that's certainly within my  |
|                |          |              | circle of competence. Over the years, I've come to           |
|                |          |              | appreciate Apple not as a tech company but as a consumer     |
|                |          |              | products giant with a sticky ecosystem that creates          |
|                |          |              | significant switching costs—a competitive moat if I ever saw |
|                |          |              | one. The strength of their brand and ecosystem puts them in  |
|                |          |              | league with the likes of Coca-Cola in terms of consumer      |
|                |          |              | loyalty. Apple's return on equity is extraordinary at        |
|                |          |              | 151.3%, demonstrating the business's efficiency in           |
|                |          |              | generating profits from shareholder equity. However, high    |
|                |          |              | debt levels are a cause for some concern, as the             |
|                |          |              | debt-to-equity ratio is notably high at 4.0. This is         |
|                |          |              | somewhat mitigated by their strong cash flow generation, but |
|                |          |              | it's always something to keep an eye on. Management in Apple |
|                |          |              | has shown to be shareholder-friendly, with consistent        |
|                |          |              | buybacks and a good track record of dividends, akin to how I |
|                |          |              | admire the capital allocation strategies at Berkshire. Yet,  |
|                |          |              | the intrinsic value calculation suggests Apple's stock might |
|                |          |              | be overvalued at the current market price, with a            |
|                |          |              | significant negative margin of safety of -68.6%. That's a    |
|                |          |              | considerable gap and highlights the premium the market       |
|                |          |              | places on Apple's future growth prospects. Their growth,     |
|                |          |              | however, seems to be slowing, with modest earnings growth    |
|                |          |              | and a three-stage DCF that doesn't quite justify the current |
|                |          |              | price when accounting for a discount rate of 10% due to the  |
|                |          |              | associated risks. Long-term, I believe Apple's brand and     |
|                |          |              | ecosystem will endure, much like the enduring nature of      |
|                |          |              | Coca-Cola or See's Candies. Given this analysis, Apple's     |
|                |          |              | current price doesn't offer the kind of margin of safety I'd |
|                |          |              | typically look for, but its moat and brand strength provide  |
|                |          |              | some confidence in its future prospects. In comparison to    |
|                |          |              | other opportunities already in my portfolio, it doesn't      |
|                |          |              | shine as brightly, but it’s still a good business. So, while |
|                |          |              | I'm inclined to hold for the long run, I'm also cautious     |
|                |          |              | about adding more at these valuations.                       |

|                |          |              | over the years. The competitive moat of Apple is strong,     |
|                |          |              | with excellent return on equity (ROE) that has been          |
|                |          |              | consistently high across 10 periods, suggesting a durable    |
|                |          |              | competitive advantage. Their brand continues to command      |
|                |          |              | customer loyalty, and they have pricing power with           |

|                |          |              | moat. Management appears to be acting in a                   |
|                |          |              | shareholder-friendly manner, consistently repurchasing       |
|                |          |              | shares and paying dividends. This is the type of             |
|                |          |              | owner-oriented management I like, reminiscent of what I've   |
|                |          |              | seen in companies like See's Candies, where management's     |
|                |          |              | focus aligns with shareholders' interests. Financially,      |
|                |          |              | Apple has some areas of concern. While profitability metrics |
|                |          |              | such as ROE and free cash flow remain strong, the high       |
|                |          |              | debt-to-equity ratio of 4.0 and a weak current ratio of 0.8  |
|                |          |              | indicate some liquidity constraints and risk potential.      |
|                |          |              | Earnings growth is modest, and the book value growth is      |
|                |          |              | tepid. On the valuation side, the current market cap far     |
|                |          |              | exceeds the intrinsic value estimates, suggesting the stock  |
|                |          |              | is overvalued with a negative margin of safety of -68.5%. In |
|                |          |              | terms of long-term prospects, Apple's innovation pipeline    |
|                |          |              | and ecosystem provide confidence, but the current valuation, |
|                |          |              | combined with limited pricing power analysis and earnings    |
|                |          |              | growth concerns, presents a red flag. It reminds me of the   |
|                |          |              | importance of paying the right price for a wonderful         |
|                |          |              | company. Despite a remarkable business model and strong      |
|                |          |              | moat, the stock's valuation does not present a comfortable   |
|                |          |              | margin of safety, which is a critical requirement for any    |

|                |          |              | portfolio, Apple remains a key holding given its enduring    |
|                |          |              | moat and robust ecosystem, but at the current valuation, it  |

| Warren Buffett | NEUTRAL  |        65.0% | Now, partner, let's sit down and chew over this. First,      |
|                |          |              | Apple sits comfortably within my circle of competence. I see |
|                |          |              | it not as a tech stock, but as a consumer products company.  |
|                |          |              | It's a barnacle on my portfolio ship, much like Coca-Cola,   |
|                |          |              | thanks to its ecosystem that creates those juicy switching   |
|                |          |              | costs. Apple has a powerful competitive moat, evident from   |
|                |          |              | its stellar return on equity and consistent margins that     |
|                |          |              | reflect robust pricing power and brand strength. Management  |
|                |          |              | has shown itself to be shareholder-friendly by repurchasing  |
|                |          |              | shares and maintaining a steady dividend, which is the kind  |
|                |          |              | of prudent capital allocation that folks like me... and you  |
|                |          |              | should appreciate. However, we've got to address the         |
|                |          |              | elephant in the room: the financials. While Apple's          |
|                |          |              | operating margins impress, their high debt-to-equity ratio   |
|                |          |              | of 4.0 and weak liquidity position give me pause—I'm not one |
|                |          |              | to ignore red flags about a company's financial fortress.    |
|                |          |              | Their current ratio below 1 suggests potential liquidity     |
|                |          |              | concerns in a pinch. The valuation is another concern; the   |
|                |          |              | current market cap is significantly above calculated         |
|                |          |              | intrinsic value. We always look for a margin of safety, and  |
|                |          |              | here we've got a margin of... concern, with a steep negative |
|                |          |              | spread. Over the long haul, Apple will likely keep making    |
|                |          |              | headway due to its brand cachet and captive consumer base.   |
|                |          |              | But at this price, the risks don't balance well with the     |
|                |          |              | rewards. Compared to the likes of Coca-Cola or other         |
|                |          |              | favorites in my basket, where intrinsic value and market     |
|                |          |              | value harmonize, Apple falls short at this moment. Best to   |
|                |          |              | heed good ole wisdom: don't bet the farm on a company that's |
|                |          |              | priced too richly. We're better off keeping a patient watch, |
|                |          |              | ready to pounce if valuation aligns with prudent investing   |
|                |          |              | principles.                                                  |

+================+==========+==============+==============================================================+
| Warren Buffett | NEUTRAL  |        75.0% | First, let's check whether Apple falls within my circle of   |
|                |          |              | competence. Despite being considered a tech company, I view  |
|                |          |              | Apple as a consumer products business with an ecosystem that |
|                |          |              | fosters significant switching costs, much like how Coca-Cola |
|                |          |              | benefits from its brand strength. Hence, Apple does fit      |
|                |          |              | squarely in my circle of competence due to its simple and    |
|                |          |              | intuitive business model. Now, let's examine the competitive |
|                |          |              | moat. Apple's strong brand and ecosystem create a durable    |
|                |          |              | competitive advantage, akin to how See's Candies creates a   |
|                |          |              | moat with customer loyalty and brand perception. The data    |
|                |          |              | tells us Apple has exhibited a robust return on equity,      |
|                |          |              | averaging over 154%, which suggests a deep, enduring moat.   |
|                |          |              | Additionally, stable operating margins further reinforce     |
|                |          |              | this competitive position, signaling pricing power despite   |
|                |          |              | limited explicit pricing power analysis. Turning to          |
|                |          |              | management, the company's tendency to repurchase shares and  |
|                |          |              | reliably pay dividends aligns with a shareholder-friendly    |
|                |          |              | approach. This reflects quality management that allocates    |
|                |          |              | capital wisely, akin to how we run Berkshire Hathaway with a |
|                |          |              | long-term perspective in mind. However, the financials       |
|                |          |              | present a mixed picture. While Apple demonstrates            |
|                |          |              | significant profitability and return on assets, the high     |
|                |          |              | debt-to-equity ratio of 4.0 and weak liquidity with a        |
|                |          |              | current ratio of 0.8 could raise caution if not managed      |
|                |          |              | carefully. On valuation, Apple's current market cap greatly  |
|                |          |              | exceeds the intrinsic value estimates, indicating a negative |
|                |          |              | margin of safety. As I always say, 'Price is what you pay,   |
|                |          |              | value is what you get.' The current figures suggest we're    |
|                |          |              | potentially paying too much for what could be obtained.      |
|                |          |              | Despite expected consistency from Apple, given their         |
|                |          |              | historical performance and brand strength, the valuation     |
|                |          |              | requires careful attention. Moreover, the long-term          |
|                |          |              | prospects for Apple seem steady, but growth appears slow,    |
|                |          |              | raising questions about how they might sustain the current   |
|                |          |              | market enthusiasm. Comparatively, within my portfolio, Apple |
|                |          |              | remains a strong blue-chip holding, but the decreased margin |
|                |          |              | of safety offers reason for a more cautious approach.        |
|                |          |              | Overall, while I'm favorably inclined toward Apple from a    |
|                |          |              | qualitative standpoint, the quantitative valuation demands   |
|                |          |              | prudence, leading me to maintain a neutral stance for now,   |
|                |          |              | at a confidence level of 75%. Owning a business like Apple   |
|                |          |              | at a fair price would still be preferable to holding a fair  |
|                |          |              | business at a seemingly wonderful price, yet the current     |
|                |          |              | high valuations make a bullish signal difficult.             |

|                |          |              | share repurchases and regular dividend payments. However,    |
|                |          |              | Apple's financial health shows some room for improvement.    |
|                |          |              | The high debt-to-equity ratio is a concern, and its          |
|                |          |              | relatively weak liquidity ratios remind me of a runner       |
|                |          |              | needing to catch a breath—something unusual given Apple's    |
|                |          |              | immense cash-generating ability. Yet, consistent earnings    |
|                |          |              | with only moderate growth are slightly worrisome but not     |
|                |          |              | alarming. When it comes to valuation, we're witnessing a     |
|                |          |              | classic case where 'price is what you pay, value is what you |
|                |          |              | get.' The intrinsic value suggests that Apple's current      |
|                |          |              | market capitalization is substantially higher than its       |
|                |          |              | estimated intrinsic value, highlighting a lack of margin of  |
|                |          |              | safety. In the long haul, Apple's ecosystem should continue  |
|                |          |              | appealing to consumers, and its competitive position appears |
|                |          |              | sound. That said, from a valuation perspective, it doesn't   |
|                |          |              | match up to the likes of Coca-Cola or GEICO when we first    |
|                |          |              | acquired them at mouth-watering prices. All said, I admire   |
|                |          |              | Apple's business quality but can't ignore its stretched      |
|                |          |              | valuation, leading to a neutral stance.                      |

| Warren Buffett | BEARISH  |        65.0% | First and foremost, Apple is certainly within my circle of   |
|                |          |              | competence, not as a tech company, but as a consumer goods   |
|                |          |              | company with a strong ecosystem that creates substantial     |
|                |          |              | switching costs for its consumers. It's akin to Coca-Cola in |
|                |          |              | its brand strength, which makes it a solid business to       |
|                |          |              | consider. Apple’s durability as a business is supported by a |
|                |          |              | significant competitive moat, evidenced by its excellent ROE |
|                |          |              | consistency and strong operating margins, which are          |
|                |          |              | reminiscent of the durable competitive advantages I seek.    |
|                |          |              | Effective asset utilization suggests operational efficiency, |
|                |          |              | which fits well with the concept of having a moat. Now,      |
|                |          |              | looking at management, Apple has a track record of           |
|                |          |              | repurchasing shares and paying dividends, indicating a       |
|                |          |              | shareholder-friendly approach, much like how we see          |
|                |          |              | management's role in a company like See's Candies. However,  |
|                |          |              | its current financial health raises some concerns. Although  |
|                |          |              | Apple shows strong operating margins, its financial          |
|                |          |              | leverage, with a high debt-to-equity ratio, and weak         |
|                |          |              | liquidity aren't ideal, as I typically prefer companies with |
|                |          |              | a fortress-like balance sheet. Moreover, the valuation is    |
|                |          |              | where things start to diverge for me. The current market cap |
|                |          |              | significantly exceeds my conservative estimates of intrinsic |
|                |          |              | value, indicating a large negative margin of safety. The     |
|                |          |              | company's current pricing suggests that the market may be    |
|                |          |              | overly optimistic about its growth potential, which isn't    |
|                |          |              | supported by solid earnings growth or free cash flow yields. |
|                |          |              | We want to buy great companies when they are inexpensive     |
|                |          |              | compared to their intrinsic value, and this mismatch between |
|                |          |              | price and value is a red flag. In terms of long-term         |
|                |          |              | prospects, while Apple has a history of consumer loyalty,    |
|                |          |              | the low growth rates in earnings, free cash flow, and        |
|                |          |              | revenue are noticeable and could suggest that Apple's best   |
|                |          |              | growth years are behind it. When I compare Apple to current  |
|                |          |              | holdings in my portfolio, like Coca-Cola or BNSF, they often |
|                |          |              | present a stronger alignment with my investment criteria in  |
|                |          |              | terms of predictable cash flows and intrinsic value. Given   |
|                |          |              | these factors, while Apple remains a wonderful company, the  |
|                |          |              | market is not offering it to us at a wonderful price right   |
|                |          |              | now. Thus, I would remain conservative and patient, as there |
|                |          |              | is no penalty for waiting for a better opportunity.          |
