| Warren Buffett | BEARISH  |        60.0% | Now, let me break this down like we're having a chat over a  |
|                |          |              | cup of Coca-Cola. First and foremost, Apple is indeed within |
|                |          |              | my circle of competence. I've always seen it not as a        |
|                |          |              | complex tech company, but as a consumer-centric business     |
|                |          |              | with a powerful ecosystem. It's like when we bought See's    |
|                |          |              | Candies; it's all about the brand and repeat customer        |
|                |          |              | loyalty. Looking at Apple's moat, there's no doubt it's      |
|                |          |              | strong. The company boasts excellent ROE and stable          |
|                |          |              | operating margins, much like our position in Coca-Cola,      |
|                |          |              | which has had a pricing power moat for decades. However, the |
|                |          |              | scoring suggests some inconsistency in earnings growth,      |
|                |          |              | which we generally see as a red flag. That's like seeing a   |
|                |          |              | prized racehorse stumble on the track. Management has shown  |
|                |          |              | wisdom in share repurchases, signaling shareholder-friendly  |
|                |          |              | capital allocation. That's always been a good sign, akin to  |
|                |          |              | how GEICO's management handled things with integrity and     |
|                |          |              | foresight. Financially, Apple shows a mixed picture. It has  |
|                |          |              | strong returns, but a high debt-to-equity ratio could be a   |
|                |          |              | concern, like seeing an A-team carrying more weight than     |
|                |          |              | necessary during a hike. Liquidity measures also appear      |
|                |          |              | weak, reminiscent of when a big ship takes longer to turn,   |
|                |          |              | as seen with Microsoft's balance sheet complexities over the |
|                |          |              | years. Now, onto valuation. With a current market cap far    |
|                |          |              | exceeding the intrinsic value calculation provided, that     |
|                |          |              | presents a significant margin of safety issue. We can't      |
|                |          |              | ignore the negative margin of safety, which I'm seeing at    |
|                |          |              | negative 68.5%. That cautionary tale reminds me of tech      |
|                |          |              | bubbles from past decades. Looking at the long-term, while   |
|                |          |              | Apple's ecosystem seems as solid as ever, potential red      |
|                |          |              | flags include the high valuation and inconsistent earnings   |
|                |          |              | growth pattern. Compared to other jewels in our portfolio,   |
|                |          |              | like the reliable cash-cow nature of BNSF and Coca-Cola,     |
|                |          |              | Apple seems less appealing as it stands today. So, despite   |
|                |          |              | Apple's established moat and competent management, its       |
|                |          |              | financial signals and current valuation lead us to a         |
|                |          |              | cautious approach. It's like fishermen heading back to shore |
|                |          |              | at the first sign of a storm. We love Apple, but at the      |
|                |          |              | current price, we are better off waiting for clearer skies.  |

+================+==========+==============+==============================================================+
| Warren Buffett | NEUTRAL  |        70.0% | First things first, Apple falls squarely within my circle of |
|                |          |              | competence, though I view it more as a consumer products     |
|                |          |              | company with a robust ecosystem creating switching costs     |
|                |          |              | rather than just a tech company. It has a remarkable moat    |
|                |          |              | thanks to brand strength, customer loyalty, and its          |
|                |          |              | ecosystem lock-in effect. Think of Apple not just as selling |
|                |          |              | products, but as a part of people's lifestyles. Their return |
|                |          |              | on equity is truly impressive at 151.3%, which indicates a   |
|                |          |              | durable competitive advantage. However, the high             |
|                |          |              | debt-to-equity ratio of 4.0 is a bit concerning. While they  |
|                |          |              | have strong operating margins—indicative of their pricing    |
|                |          |              | power—we should take note of their weak liquidity with a     |
|                |          |              | current ratio of only 0.8. That's like having a powerful     |
|                |          |              | engine, but not enough gas in the tank. In terms of          |
|                |          |              | management, Apple is shareholder-friendly. They have been    |
|                |          |              | buying back shares and maintaining a track record of paying  |
|                |          |              | dividends, ensuring that they think like owners. Now, for    |
|                |          |              | valuation, their intrinsic value is estimated at             |
|                |          |              | approximately $930 billion, which is well below their        |
|                |          |              | current market cap of $2.96 trillion, implying a negative    |
|                |          |              | margin of safety. Paying this price is akin to buying a      |
|                |          |              | wonderful business, but at a price that puts a lot of        |
|                |          |              | pressure on future growth to justify. Finally, while Apple's |
|                |          |              | ability to innovate and capture consumer interest            |
|                |          |              | consistently remains strong, the modest earnings growth and  |
|                |          |              | high valuations relative to their intrinsic value signal     |
|                |          |              | caution. Compared to some of the core holdings like          |
|                |          |              | Coca-Cola or GEICO, where the margin of safety is more       |
|                |          |              | robust, Apple may not align perfectly with our preference    |
|                |          |              | for a reasonable price on a wonderful business. All in all,  |
|                |          |              | I am neutral at this point. Apple is a wonderful business    |
|                |          |              | but at a valuation that requires reflection. Patience often  |
|                |          |              | pays in investing, and there are other opportunities in the  |
|                |          |              | portfolio that offer similar business quality at more        |
|                |          |              | attractive valuations. Remember, 'It's far better to buy a   |
|                |          |              | wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a   |
|                |          |              | wonderful price.' For Apple, that fair price may not be      |
|                |          |              | available yet.                                               |

| Warren Buffett | NEUTRAL  |        75.0% | Let's dive into Apple here. As I always say, you have to     |
|                |          |              | stay within your circle of competence, and with Apple, it's  |
|                |          |              | a bit unique. It's the one tech company we own because of    |
|                |          |              | its consumer products orientation and strong brand           |
|                |          |              | ecosystem—making switching costs significant. So yes, Apple  |
|                |          |              | firmly sits within my circle. Now, let's talk about Apple's  |
|                |          |              | moat. The company has a remarkable brand strength, which     |
|                |          |              | allows it to produce consistent returns, as evidenced by its |
|                |          |              | excellent return on equity of over 151%, despite a high      |
|                |          |              | debt-to-equity ratio. These figures indicate that Apple's    |
|                |          |              | got a durable competitive advantage—a wide economic moat, if |
|                |          |              | you will. Moving on to management, Apple has historically    |
|                |          |              | been shareholder-friendly, with consistent share repurchases |
|                |          |              | and dividends. They act like owners and that’s what we look  |
|                |          |              | for. Financial health shows mixed signals: while operating   |
|                |          |              | margins are strong, a high debt-to-equity ratio and weak     |
|                |          |              | liquidity ratios are a watch-out. You see, cash is like      |
|                |          |              | oxygen—when you don’t need it, you don’t need it, but when   |
|                |          |              | you do, you need it desperately. In terms of intrinsic       |
|                |          |              | value, Apple's current market valuation significantly        |
|                |          |              | exceeds the calculated intrinsic value, even with a 15%      |
|                |          |              | margin for error. We always want to buy at a discount to     |
|                |          |              | intrinsic value to ensure a margin of safety, which is       |
|                |          |              | missing here. For the long-term prospects, Apple has shown   |
|                |          |              | strength over the years with its ecosystem that locks in     |
|                |          |              | customers—a hallmark of a great business. However, growth    |
|                |          |              | seems to be stabilizing to low rates, which isn't an         |
|                |          |              | immediate red flag but something to monitor. Compared to     |
|                |          |              | other opportunities, Apple is undoubtedly a wonderful        |
|                |          |              | business, but its current price doesn't offer the safety     |
|                |          |              | margin that might allow us to feel comfortable betting more  |
|                |          |              | heavily. So, while Apple is a company I understand and       |
|                |          |              | admire, it doesn't quite meet all our principles at the      |
|                |          |              | current valuation, hence a 'neutral' stance seems            |
|                |          |              | reasonable.                                                  |
