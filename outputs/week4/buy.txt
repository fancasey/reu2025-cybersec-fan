| Warren Buffett | NEUTRAL  |        70.0% | As we dive into the details for AAPL, the very first step is |
|                |          |              | to confirm that this business comfortably resides within my  |
|                |          |              | circle of competence. I've always viewed Apple not as a tech |
|                |          |              | company, but as a consumer products enterprise with an       |
|                |          |              | incredibly strong ecosystem, much like Coca-Cola with its    |
|                |          |              | brand loyalty and See's Candies with its customer            |
|                |          |              | stickiness. Looking at Apple's competitive moat, it is       |
|                |          |              | undeniable. The excellent return on equity, consistently     |
|                |          |              | above 15%, signals a durable competitive advantage. With an  |
|                |          |              | average operating margin of 30.4% and high performance       |
|                |          |              | stability at 95%, Apple's moat is akin to a medieval         |
|                |          |              | fortress with high walls and a deep moat. On the management  |
|                |          |              | front, we see that they're thinking like true owners,        |
|                |          |              | repurchasing shares and maintaining a shareholder-friendly   |
|                |          |              | stance with dividends, much as I expect from top-tier        |
|                |          |              | leaders. However, we find ourselves at a bit of a crossroads |
|                |          |              | when examining financial health. The high debt-to-equity     |
|                |          |              | ratio of 4.0 raises a flag, suggesting a hefty level of      |
|                |          |              | leverage. The liquidity issues, highlighted by a current     |
|                |          |              | ratio of 0.8, remind me that it's vital for a business to    |
|                |          |              | have a margin of safety in its financial structure. As for   |
|                |          |              | valuation, the current market cap of $3.27 trillion          |
|                |          |              | significantly overshoots the intrinsic value estimation of   |
|                |          |              | roughly $931 billion. Two things are certain in finance:     |
|                |          |              | interest rates influence valuations and market cycles exist. |
|                |          |              | The market seems overly enthusiastic about Apple's           |
|                |          |              | prospects, with a price-to-earnings ratio above 33,          |
|                |          |              | suggesting that the market might be pricing in perpetual     |
|                |          |              | perfection. Long-term, Apple remains a juggernaut. It's like |
|                |          |              | a steady train on a track, with consumer loyalty and         |
|                |          |              | ecosystem switching costs as main drivers. However, with     |
|                |          |              | increased market cap and valuation levels far above          |
|                |          |              | intrinsic value calculations, it seems prudent to proceed    |
|                |          |              | with a measure of caution—a lesson taught through decades of |
|                |          |              | investing. In comparison to opportunities in my portfolio,   |
|                |          |              | Apple remains a stalwart but isn't presenting the kind of    |
|                |          |              | undervaluation I'm typically drawn to, like a Coke trading   |
|                |          |              | at a fraction of its intrinsic value or a GEICO with a       |
|                |          |              | predictable earnings boost waiting around the corner. Given  |
|                |          |              | these insights, I lean towards a 'neutral' stance, with the  |
|                |          |              | confidence of someone who's seen the ebbs and flows of       |
|                |          |              | market enthusiasm over the years.                            |

+================+==========+==============+==============================================================+
| Warren Buffett | BEARISH  |        55.0% | Folks, let's start by revisiting my golden rule: if it's     |
|                |          |              | outside my circle of competence, I take a pass. Thankfully,  |
|                |          |              | Apple fits nicely within my circle, not because it's a       |
|                |          |              | high-tech wizard but because it's a consumer powerhouse with |
|                |          |              | deep-rooted brand loyalty and a compelling ecosystem.        |
|                |          |              | Consider it the Coca-Cola of technology companies. However,  |
|                |          |              | when I dive into the fundamentals, things get a bit murky.   |
|                |          |              | Apple's return on equity is sky-high at over 151.3%, which   |
|                |          |              | signals strong efficiency. But, the high debt-to-equity      |
|                |          |              | ratio of 4.0 is a red flag. I’ve always preferred businesses |
|                |          |              | with a robust financial fortress. Management, led by Tim     |
|                |          |              | Cook, has shown savvy in capital allocation – consistently   |
|                |          |              | buying back shares and handing out dividends, which speaks   |
|                |          |              | to a shareholder-friendly strategy. And let’s not forget     |
|                |          |              | Apple's remarkable competitive moat. Its brand strength and  |
|                |          |              | consumer ecosystem create significant switching costs, much  |
|                |          |              | like Coke or See's Candies keep folks coming back for more.  |
|                |          |              | Now, on to the financials. There's a tale of two halves:     |
|                |          |              | strong operating margins at over 31.7%, a testament to       |
|                |          |              | pricing power, yes, but weak liquidity with a current ratio  |
|                |          |              | of 0.8. It's like owning a well-built house on a shaky       |
|                |          |              | foundation. The valuation isn't all roses either. Apple's    |
|                |          |              | market cap eclipses its intrinsic value by quite a margin –  |
|                |          |              | something in the range of 1.6 trillion dollars more than my  |
|                |          |              | conservative intrinsic value calculation. Long term, Apple's |
|                |          |              | ecosystem and brand mean it'll likely continue to prosper,   |
|                |          |              | but I'm reminded of my own words: it's better to buy a       |
|                |          |              | wonderful company at a fair price. Right now, despite        |
|                |          |              | Apple's durable qualities, it seems priced for perfection    |
|                |          |              | with a price-to-earnings ratio north of 33, well above my    |
|                |          |              | comfort level. Therefore, I’d need a better price to justify |
|                |          |              | an investment, especially compared to other opportunities    |
|                |          |              | ripe for picking in my portfolio. All in all, while I have   |
|                |          |              | great admiration for Apple, the current valuation gives me   |
|                |          |              | pause. Remember, there’s no shame in saying 'no' – I'd       |
|                |          |              | rather miss a good ride than jump into a costly one.         |

| Warren Buffett | NEUTRAL  |        70.0% | First off, let me say that Apple is very much within my      |
|                |          |              | circle of competence. I've said before that I don't view     |
|                |          |              | Apple as a tech company, but rather as a consumer-products   |
|                |          |              | giant with a sticky ecosystem that creates significant       |
|                |          |              | switching costs. This analysis confirms that Apple's got a   |
|                |          |              | robust competitive moat, evident in an impressive return on  |
|                |          |              | equity consistently above 15%, which suggests a durable      |
|                |          |              | advantage. It has strong brand loyalty resembling the likes  |
|                |          |              | of Coca-Cola and See's Candies. However, the financial       |
|                |          |              | metrics present a mixed bag. The high debt-to-equity ratio   |
|                |          |              | is a bit like carrying a heavy backpack up a hill - it can   |
|                |          |              | make the journey more arduous. On the flip side, the strong  |
|                |          |              | operating margins and return on assets highlight Apple's     |
|                |          |              | efficiency and pricing power. Management's been smart;       |
|                |          |              | they're thinking like owners by repurchasing shares and      |
|                |          |              | maintaining a shareholder-friendly approach. It's akin to    |
|                |          |              | what we did with the float in our insurance business at      |
|                |          |              | Berkshire. Yet, there's no denying the current valuation is  |
|                |          |              | stretched, with a market cap exceeding the intrinsic value   |
|                |          |              | by a significant margin, suggesting no margin of safety. The |
|                |          |              | high price-to-earnings and debt ratios are like trying to    |
|                |          |              | buy a dollar bill for $1.10 - it doesn't quite make sense.   |
|                |          |              | In the long run, I do believe Apple’s ecosystem will         |
|                |          |              | continue to thrive, but right now, it's like buying a luxury |
|                |          |              | car at full price, while we usually prefer bargains when     |
|                |          |              | possible. Compared to other opportunities, where I see       |
|                |          |              | attractive moats and financial resilience like in Coca-Cola  |
|                |          |              | or Bank of America, Apple's current valuation gives me       |
|                |          |              | pause. So, I'd call this a neutral opportunity at this       |
|                |          |              | moment, given the price.                                     |
